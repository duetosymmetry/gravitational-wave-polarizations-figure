# gravitational-wave-polarizations-figure
Customizable figure showing gravitational wave polarizations (PDF and source Mma code)

Below is what the figure looks like.  Note that below is a rasterized PNG preview, not a vector graphic.
Grab [polarizations.pdf](polarizations.pdf) if you just want a vector graphic.
If you want to customize things in Mathematica, grab [polarizations.nb](polarizations.nb).
